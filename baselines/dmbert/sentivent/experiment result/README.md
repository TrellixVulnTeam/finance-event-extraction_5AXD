# Recording and Comparison

In this folder, we compare the performance of 2 models based on SENTIVENT and ACE05 with different learning rates or split proportions.

The summary file is *result.xlsx*.

In *logs-bertcrf* or *logs-dmbert*, I put related logs corresponding to numbers from the *result.xlsx* file and the log file is named as *dataset_lr_(test test proportion).err*
